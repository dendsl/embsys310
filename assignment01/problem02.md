# Question
Why use twoâ€™s complement to represent negative numbers?

# Answer
Two's complement representation allows the same arithmetic operations that are used for unsigned binary representation. This allows for simplicity from a program implementation perspective. We can implement/carry out the same operations by simply representing negative numbers in the two's complement form.
