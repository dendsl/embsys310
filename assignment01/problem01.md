# Problem Statement
Using the telegraph example, and the challenges listed in the module as reference, and describe
another device that you would like to discuss. Describe how you think its embedded system
works, and what design challenges it presents?

# Answer - Apple's AirPods
## Implementation
I think the AirPod's embedded system is comprised of atleast the following modules:
- *Power*: 
  - the AirPod's must employ a power consumption system to limit the power consumption when functionalities are not in use (i.e. toggling noise cancellation)
  - the AirPod's must have a battery built-in to charge the pair of earbuds, as well as a way to charge the main battery when the device is plugged in
- Bluetooth 
  - 
- Digital Signal Processing
- Haptic Feedback
